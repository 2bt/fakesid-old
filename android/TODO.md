Thank you so much!

First, I am using app on Android 9.

request
・When I tried to select the tab at the top of the screen, I found that the function of the screen shot was often activated. so I think, moving the tab slightly downwards will make it easier to operate the tab

・I want you to be able to play in the background

・I want to be able to change specify the track length, tempo, swing in the middle of a song

・I want to do partial copy & paste further in the Track tab

・I want to enable complex irregular meters(example: 4/4→7/8→4/4)

・I also want a Fake SID manual(pdf ver)

bug
・When launching or canceling the multitask function during application playback, the data being created is initialized
